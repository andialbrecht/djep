Installation
------------

First you have to clone this repository and all its submodules::

    git clone git@github.com:EuroPython/djep.git
    cd djep

Next create a virtualenv and install all the requirments into it. In this
example we are using virtualenvwrapper to manage the virtualenv::

    mkvirtualenv djep

This repository provides requirements and configurations for various
environments. Each environment (dev, staging and production) has its own
requirements.txt.

For local development, install the requirements specified in
requirements/dev.txt::

    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

Now that this is complete, you can optionally change some settings. To get an
overview of what settings are available, take a look at the pyconde.settings
module.

We are using `django-configurations`_ to manage all settings and try to expose
all relevant settings as environment variables. By default you will probably
want to set following variables::

    export DJANGO_CONFIGURATION=Dev

If you want to use a different database system than PostgreSQL and a different
database than "djep", set the ``DJANGO_DATABASE_URL`` environment variable.
You can find some examples in the `dj-database-url <https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url/blob/master/test_dj_database_url.py>`_
test module.

Another environment variable you absolutely *have to set* is
``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY``::

    export DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=...

.. note::

    Note that this value should be constant for your local installation.

Everything should be in place now to initialize the database.


.. warning::

    Make sure you have redis up and running. Otherwise Django won't start due
    to a missing connection to the cache. See `Development` section below for
    details.

If you want to use SQLite be warned that there are some issues with the
migration steps done for some of django-cms' plugins. Therefore you will most
likely have to run this::
    
    python manage.py syncdb --noinput --migrate

If you want to use PostgreSQL (which is also used in production for this site),
alter the `DATABASES` section of your pyconde/settings.py accordingly and then
run following command::
    
    python manage.py syncdb --noinput --migrate

After this is done, you should already have a working site, but it is still
empty. To change that you can load a fixture with initial data by running::

    python manage.py loaddata fixtures/europython2014/initial01.json
    python manage.py loaddata fixtures/europython2014/initial02.json

You can login as user *admin* with password *admin*

Or you create an admin user in order to gain access to the admin panel::
    
    python manage.py createsuperuser

This will prompt a couple of questions you have to fill out.

.. warning::

    Be aware that no user profile is created for this superuser as this is
    normally done during the registration process. Thus every access from a
    user instance to its profile will fail.


After this is complete, start the development-server on port 8000 with::
    
    python manage.py runserver


Style integration
-----------------

Right now this project doesn't come with compiled css files but relies on
Grunt and Compass to generate them. To install them, run the following
commands. They will also install all the requirements those tools rely on::
    
    gem install --user-install compass
    npm install
    cd pyconde/skins/ep14/static/assets && ../../../../../node_modules/bower/bin/bower install


Development
-----------

During development you will need a dummy mail server and other services that
are usually run system-wide in production. To help you keep all these services
under control the project provides a sample Procfile which you can use with
`foreman`_ or `honcho`_::
    
    $ foreman start

or::
    
    $ honcho start

However, the minimum is a running Redis server to get the project running. It
is sufficient to simply launch the server before using the `manage.py` CLI::

    $ redis-server


Using Vagrant
-------------

If you have `Vagrant`_ and `VirtualBox`_ installed, you can also use the
provided Vagrantfile to start a virtual machine with all the non-Python
requirements already installed::
    
    $ vagrant up

Once the virtual machine is running and you've ssh'd into it, you are already in a virtualenv
into which you can install the Python-requirements::
    
    $ cd /vagrant
    $ npm install
    $ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt

With this step also comes `honcho`_ which you can then start with ``honcho
start`` which starts the dev server on port 8000 which is exposed to port 8080
on your local host machine.

Note that you will need a filled database before this provides you a working
system. PostgreSQL is already available and running inside the virtual machine.
